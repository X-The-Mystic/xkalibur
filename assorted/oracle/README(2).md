1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your GitHub repository containing `data.json` and `chatbot-engine.py` to your local machine. You can use the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Setup Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**: It's good practice to set up a virtual environment for your Python project to manage dependencies. Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:
   ```
   cd <repository_directory>
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any dependencies required for your `chatbot-engine.py`. If you haven't specified any additional dependencies beyond standard Python libraries like `torch` and `numpy`, you may not need to install anything extra.

4. **Run the Chatbot Engine**: Now, you can run your chatbot engine script:
   ```
   python chatbot-engine.py --data data.json --num_epochs 10 --hidden_size 256 --learning_rate 0.01
   ```
   Adjust the command-line arguments (`--num_epochs`, `--hidden_size`, `--learning_rate`) according to your training preferences.

5. **Test the Chatbot**: After training completes (or if you're testing with pre-trained models), interact with your chatbot through the command line or integrate it into a larger application.

6. **Update and Push Changes**: If you make any changes to `data.json` or `chatbot-engine.py`, commit them to your local repository and push to GitHub:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated data.json and chatbot engine script"
   git push origin main
   ```
