This is a hacking framework make to screw with Windows. It has some extra stuff in it, so it's more well-rounded, but more than anything, this is a finger to Microsoft and it's PRISM-level of intelligence gathering. (Not you , Gates. I know this isn't your fault. Vista was brilliant.)

This idea was concieved in 2023, when I decided to consolidate all of my previous repositories into one unified collection. I began using the repository as a dump for *all* of my rough code, forked repositories, and ideas. I then began organizing it under the title of *Scrapbook*. This was my idea for a small MetaSploit-esque hacking repo. I mostly just organized the code and eliminated all of my old notes. I experimented with this for a while, until it grew into more other people's code than my own. I needed a break. So I decided to return to the core idea, the reason why I was really doing all of this. To fuck with Windows. So I rewrote it as a compiliation of all the exploits I wrote, revamped and upgraded. It has everything you need to pwn Windows 7 and below, and everything you might need to fuck up Windows 10+.

Any and all code in here is for educational purposes only. I do not condone the illegal usage of any tools in here, nor do I hold any responsibility for any actions that do so. (*wink*)
